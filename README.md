This project presents a robust Smart Parking System that utilizes computer vision to optimize parking management. A custom YOLO model, trained on a self-collected dataset of parking area images and videos, achieves an impressive 96% accuracy in detecting occupied and vacant parking slots.

The system provides real-time parking availability information through a user-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Users can conveniently book parking spaces in advance via the online platform. The backend, powered by Flask, handles user management, booking processes, and database interactions.

A comprehensive database stores user details and parking slot booking information, enabling efficient system operation.

Key features include:

Precise object detection: High-accuracy YOLO model for real-time parking slot status identification.
User-centric interface: Intuitive web platform for seamless user experience.
Efficient booking management: Online booking system for hassle-free parking.
Comprehensive database: Centralized storage of user and parking data.
By combining computer vision, web development, and database management, this project offers a practical and effective solution to address urban parking challenges.
