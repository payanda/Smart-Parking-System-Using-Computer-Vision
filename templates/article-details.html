                <h4>Project Overview</h4>
                <p>Smart Parking System using computer vision aims to revolutionize parking management by utilizing advanced technologies
                such as machine learning algorithms, computer vision, and technologies like OpenCV, YOLO (You Only Look Once), and
                PyTorch which is an open-source framework used to build a deep learning model. The system offers real-time solutions for
                efficient parking space management by continuously monitoring parking areas and accurately detecting and analyzing the
                availability of parking spots. Drivers can access this information remotely through a user-friendly mobile web-based
                application, which facilitates informed decision-making even before arriving at the parking location. Additionally, the
                system offers a booking feature that allows drivers to reserve parking slots in which they are empty slots exist in
                parking in advance, providing an extra layer of convenience. This holistic approach to parking management not only
                enhances individual user experience but also contributes to reducing traffic congestion by helping drivers navigate to
                available parking spaces more efficiently. The project's goal is to introduce a seamlessly integrated, technology-driven
                solution that improves overall parking convenience, streamlines traffic flow and sets a new standard for modern parking
                management systems.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">We trained a machine learning model, that includes YOLO(You Only Look Once), and OpenCV, and checked accuracy based on
                every algorithm after achieving better accuracy and based on that model it will detect the vehicle, Objects, Or even the
                empty slots in parking areas. the dataset on which we will train our model will include certain factors i.e. (Images of
                parking lots, Annotations, weather conditions, Vehicle model information, Time of day, and different resolutions of
                images). It will make it possible for us to detect objects and get some more accuracy for detection.</p>

                    <h4>Project Motivations</h4>
                    <p>The motivation for this project stems from the growing need for efficient parking solutions in urban and densely
                    populated areas. A Smart Parking System using computer vision can alleviate parking congestion, reduce environmental
                    impact, and enhance the overall driving experience. This project aims to leverage cutting-edge machine-learning
                    techniques to tackle this pervasive issue.</p>
                    <h4>Vision</h4>
                    <p>To empower individuals with a web-based and user-friendly website, transforming the parking experience and fostering a
                    sense of convenience and well-being in urban communities.</p>
